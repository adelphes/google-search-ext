# Google Search
 
A simple extension allowing developers to perform a Google search of any highlighted text, straight from the VS Code editor.

* Highlight some text in the editor (or just point the cursor inside a word)
* Use the VS Code Command Palette or Menu tool button to launch a preview window with the Google search results
* Links from the search open in your default browser
* Code and search without needing to switch between your browser and IDE

## Functionality

The Google search extension allows developers to highlight a section of their code 
and perform a search, displaying the results in a separate pane within VS Code.

Clicking on any of the links in the search results launches into your browser for a fuller experience.

It's simple, quick and effective.
